Hello there  
How am i___ Good i guess  
whats this game about___ i won't lie its a works in progress, like a REAL work in progress, don;t be expecting sole knight level quality though  
You didn't ask how i was__ well i hope you are doing well  
Why did you make this game__ well i had high hopes, i was planning on continuing development for the game like more art and such but i have decideded to start another project  
i want to be a solodev so i just used SoM as motivation to do it, unfortunately not living in america kinda means i don't get summer holidays so making this game has been kinda hellish what with me being in first year computer science  
(no  one ... hopefully) When will you stop whining__ wow i am sorry you feel that way, the game is in the itch.io link, there was a problem with me not making it public but that has been resolved  
( someone hopefully) so when will you start your next project__ why thank you for asking, i have begun it and coincidentally it falls within siege so i will be doing it along with siege, maybe i can then get a better laptop and get better at gamedev  
(me) thanks for the convo i really appreciate it stranger, anyway for windows download and run and i expect that to be the same for other platforms i hope , anyway see you on the voting board and bye for now
